# Collision of Primordial Black Holes with Neutron Stars

For my fourth year thesis project I am studying the interactions of primordial black holes and neutron stars.

The first model assumes a neutron star is flat, and an infinitely deep, incompressible fluid. A primordial black hole collides with the neutron star and surface waves are created.

## To run the simulations
The blackhole.py and BlackHoleEquation.py need to either be moved into the PySPH directory, or a symbolic link needs to be created.
