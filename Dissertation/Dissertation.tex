\makeabstract{
The identity of dark matter has piqued the interest of astrophysicists for quite some time. One of the possible candidates is primordial black holes, black holes possibly created by perturbations in the very early universe. Observations can put estimates on the mass ranges and number of primordial black holes in the universe which can determine their contribution to dark matter, as well as the conditions in the very early universe. In this thesis the effects a primordial black hole has on the surface of a neutron star if they were to collide is investigated. Neutron stars are treated as a flat infinite incompressible fluid in this toy model. The shape of the surface waves created, and the energy deposited into the neutron star, are found both analytically and with simulations.

\makeacknowledgements{
First and most importantly, I would like to thank my supervisor and mentor Dr. Joseph MacMillan for his assistance, guidance, and inspiration over the past four years, and especially the last eight months. \\

Next, I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Sean Bohun, Dr. Mihai Beligan, and Dr. Mehran Ebrahimi for offering their assistance to help me solve difficult differential equations and mathematical proofs. As well as Dr. Hendrick de Haan for allowing me use of Polar for conducting my simulations. I would also like to thank my fellow physics students for helping make the last four years enjoyable. \\

Lastly, I would like to thank my mom and dad, and grandparents for their endless support and encouragement over the past four years.
