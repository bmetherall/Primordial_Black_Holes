Brady,

I've modified your black hole code a bit -- to give it a velocity and to start it at any location.  But otherwise it seemed fine

I tested it with some of the simple exmaples (like the elliptical drop one, where I set the initial velocity of the 
fluid to zero, made it a rectangle instead of a circle, and let the black hole fly through -- it ended up looking pretty neat,
but not very much like what we want).  

The file "black_hole.py" is just the Equation for the black hole.  The "hydrostatic_tank.py" file is a slightly-modified version
of the example.  I changed the shape of the box and added the black hole to "REF 1" equations, and deleted the post-processing code
that was happening (that made some graphs at the end).  It made some pretty neat movies -- movie2.mpg is the highest resolution
one I made, looks pretty good.

Still more work to do; some playing around with the box shape (as big as we can, or something clever?), the mass, the velocity,
plus trying to measure the energy of the system.
